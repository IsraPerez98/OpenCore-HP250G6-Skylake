# Where to Start

When starting with Hackintoshing the best place to start your build would undoubtedly be [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io). Everything there has been well documented, each and every quirk has been throughly explained and still if you are facing issues, I would recommend to re-read the entire documentation or search for relevant terms. If you still don't get it, then you can always head over to these discord servers for further help and clarification -

# Why Hackintosh

Although Hackintoshing is legal as long as the builds are not commercialized, apple does frown upon such devices as they are not authorized by apple. So, there is a chance you might face issues with your apple ID if you do something stupid.

That being said, there are many other reasons why one would want to install macOSX on a non-apple device.

- Budget Issues
- Gaming (Using the same device for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux)
- Developing apps for iOS and Mac or making existing applications cross-compatible
- Just for Aesthetics (Gotta be honest, Mac OS does look good)
